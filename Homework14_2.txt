[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git remote -v
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DeusDimitrius/lection_14_hw
fatal: No such remote 'origin'
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git remote add origin https://github.com/DeusDimitrius/lection_14_hw.git
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git remote -v
