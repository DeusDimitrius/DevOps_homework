1. Git Task 1:

1) Create local repository named lection_14_hw:

[root@localhost ~]# mkdir lection_14_hw
[root@localhost ~]# cd lection_14_hw/
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /root/lection_14_hw/.git/

2) Create file "homework" in this repo and commit it in master branch:

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# touch homework
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git branch
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git add homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git commit -m "Add homework"
[master (root-commit) bdedb1b] Add homework
 Committer: root <root@localhost.localdomain>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 homework
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git branch
* master

3) Create branch "hw_14" and insert anything in the file and commit these changes to this branch:

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git checkout -b hw_14
Switched to a new branch 'hw_14'
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# vim homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# cat homework

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git branch
* hw_14
  master
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git status
# On branch hw_14
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   homework
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git add homework
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git commit -m "Mod homework"
[hw_14 f8a1176] Mod homework

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# vim homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# vim homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# cat homework

5) Merge branch "hw_14" to "master", keep only changes from "hw_14" branch:

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git branch
  hw_14
* master
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git merge hw_14
Auto-merging homework
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in homework
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# cat homework 
<<<<<<< HEAD
abc

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# vim homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# cat homework 
123123

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git add homework 
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git commit -m "Merged master fixed conflict"
[master a490873] Merged master fixed conflict
....

6) Switch to "hw_14" branch again and create new file "temp_file" and commit it:

[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git  checkout hw_14
Switched to branch 'hw_14'
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# touch temp_file
[root@localhost lection_14_hw]# git add temp_file
